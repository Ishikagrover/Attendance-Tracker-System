## 🧠 How the Program Works

1. The program starts by showing a welcome message explaining that attendance will be recorded.
2. The user decides how many attendance entries they want to input.
3. For each entry:
   - The student name and check-in time are entered.
   - The program checks if:
     - The name is not empty
     - The time is not empty
     - The student has not already been entered
4. After collecting all the data, the program displays the attendance list in a neat table.
5. Finally, the program optionally lets you **save the attendance report** to a file.
